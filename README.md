# Thinkback

Thinkback is a website that allows the user to submit his assignment through the website's file upload system. The websites categorizes assignments into two, active assignments and past assignments. The ThinkBack system will then notify if the user's submission passed or failed, giving the results of the tests made.

### Getting started

To get the website running on your local machine you must do the following steps. </br>

You need to have SQLite installed (https://sqlite.org/index.html)</br>
You need to have python3 installed (https://www.python.org/)</br>
You need to have pip installed (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)</br>
And you need to have flask installed (http://flask.pocoo.org/)</br>

### Installing

Once you have those programs up and running, unzip the downloaded folder to the desired location. The next step is to set up a local server with flask. You need to run the following commands in a terminal :</br>

`export FLASK_APP=thinkback.py`</br>
`flask run`</br>

This will launch the server and be able to run on your computer.

### Deploying 

It is not recommended to deploy the system on a live server since this program is in it's early alpha stage, and has not gone trough extensive security testing.
